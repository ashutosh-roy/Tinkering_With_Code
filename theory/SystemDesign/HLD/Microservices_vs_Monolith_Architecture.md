## Key Comparison

| **Aspect**            | **Microservices**                  | **Monolith**                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**        | Independent, small services.       | Unified codebase.                      |
| **Scalability**       | Scales horizontally per service.   | Scales vertically as a whole.          |
| **Deployment**        | Independent service deployment.    | Entire app redeployed for changes.     |
| **Resilience**        | Isolated failures.                 | Single failure affects the entire app. |
| **Cost**              | Higher infra and management costs. | Lower infra costs.                     |
| **Use Case Fit**      | Large, evolving systems.           | Small, well-defined systems.           |

## Real-Life Examples (2024)

### **Microservices Example: Netflix**
- **Why?** Scalability, resilience, and independent deployments for global reach and millions of users.

### **Monolith Example: Shopify**
- **Why?** Modular monolith for cost-efficiency, reduced latency, and simplicity in managing core e-commerce functionality.

## Trade-Off Summary

- **Microservices**: Ideal for large-scale, independent systems but introduce complexity and higher costs.
- **Monoliths**: Best for simplicity and cost efficiency, especially for smaller or stable applications.

### **Conclusion**
Both architectures have specific use cases. Choose based on scale, operational needs, and long-term goals.
