## Core Kafka Concepts

### 1. **What are Kafka Topics, Partitions, and Offsets, and why are they critical in Kafka’s architecture?**
- **Topics**: Logical channels to categorize messages (e.g., `payments`, `orders`).
- **Partitions**: A topic is split into partitions to enable parallelism. Each partition is a log where messages are appended sequentially.
- **Offsets**: Each message within a partition has a unique ID (offset) for tracking consumption.

**Importance**: Partitions allow Kafka to scale horizontally by distributing data across brokers and enabling consumers to process data in parallel.

### 2. **What is Kafka’s event log model, and how does it differ from traditional message queues?**
- Kafka retains messages for a configurable time, even after consumption, unlike traditional queues that delete messages post-consumption.
- Consumers can replay messages by resetting their offset.
- Kafka supports both publish-subscribe and queue semantics.

**Key Difference**: Kafka’s log-based storage allows durable, scalable, and high-throughput message handling.

## Producer and Consumer

### 3. **Explain Kafka’s producer acknowledgment levels (`acks=0`, `acks=1`, `acks=all`). How do they affect reliability and performance?**
- **`acks=0`**: No acknowledgment; fastest but no guarantee of message delivery.
- **`acks=1`**: Leader acknowledgment; moderate reliability and performance.
- **`acks=all`**: Leader and replicas acknowledge; highest reliability but slower performance.

**Impact**: Choose based on use case:
- `acks=0` for low-latency scenarios (e.g., logs).
- `acks=all` for critical data (e.g., financial transactions).

---

### 4. **How does Kafka ensure at-least-once and exactly-once delivery guarantees?**
- **At-least-once**: Default behavior; consumers must handle duplicate processing.
- **Exactly-once**: Enabled via `transactional.id` in producers and idempotence; ensures no duplicates or data loss.

**Use Case**: Exactly-once is critical for financial or inventory systems requiring precise updates.

## Performance and Scaling

### 5. **How would you handle a scenario where consumers cannot keep up with producers (backpressure)?**
- **Consumer Group Scaling**: Add more consumers to the group to process partitions in parallel.
- **Throttling Producers**: Adjust the rate at which producers send messages.
- **Processing Delays**: Use a retry mechanism or buffer messages temporarily.

**Impact**: Balances system throughput and avoids overwhelming consumers.

---

### 6. **How do Kafka’s partitioning strategies impact scalability and throughput?**
- Kafka partitions allow parallel processing by mapping data to partitions using keys.
- Custom partitioners can ensure even distribution or handle ordering requirements.

**Best Practice**: Use meaningful keys (e.g., `user_id`) for even load distribution.

---

### 7. **Explain how Kafka handles fault tolerance at the broker and topic levels.**
- **Replication**: Each partition has replicas across brokers.
- **Leader Election**: If a leader fails, a replica takes over.
- **ACK Configurations**: Ensure replicas are in sync for durability.

**Result**: High availability and resilience to broker failures.

## Real-World Application

### 8. **Design a Kafka-based system for a payment processing application. How would you handle ordering and retries?**
- **Ordering**: Use a partition key (e.g., `user_id`) to ensure all transactions for a user are sent to the same partition.
- **Retries**: Use a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for messages that fail after retries, enabling manual or automated recovery.

**Architecture**:
1. Producers send payment messages to a `payments` topic.
2. Consumers process payments, ensuring idempotent handling for retries.

---

### 9. **What metrics would you monitor in Kafka for a production system, and how would you set up monitoring?**
- **Lag**: Measures how far consumers are behind producers.
- **Throughput**: Tracks message rates.
- **Broker Health**: Monitors disk usage, CPU, and memory.
- **Partition State**: Checks for under-replicated partitions.

**Tools**: Use Prometheus with Grafana or Kafka Manager for real-time monitoring.

---

### 10. **Explain the role of Kafka Streams in an event-driven system. When would you use it over traditional consumers?**
- Kafka Streams allows stateful processing (e.g., aggregations, joins) of event data in real-time.
- Use for applications requiring data transformation or enrichment directly in the stream pipeline.

**Example**: Calculate real-time metrics like user transactions per minute.

### Bonus

### 11. **What changes has Kafka made with KRaft to remove its dependency on ZooKeeper, and why is this important?**
- KRaft (Kafka Raft Metadata mode) replaces ZooKeeper with Kafka’s internal Raft protocol for metadata management.
- Benefits:
  - Simplifies deployment.
  - Improves scalability and fault tolerance.
  - Reduces operational overhead.

**Impact**: Streamlines Kafka operations while enhancing reliability.
