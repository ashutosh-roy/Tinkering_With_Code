``` 
 Time complexity :
 - O(2 * n) - The outer while loop i.e. the right pointer can move up to index n-1(the last index). 
 - Now, the inner while loop i.e. the left pointer can move up to the right pointer at most. 
 - So, every time the inner loop does not run for n times rather it can run for n times in total. 
 - So, the time complexity will be O(2*N) instead of O(N^2).


 
 Space Complexity :
 O(1) - since there was no Data Structure (for e.g., map or array) initialised to solve this.
