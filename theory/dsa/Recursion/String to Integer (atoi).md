## String to Integer (atoi)

### Brute Force Approach :

*

``` 
 Time complexity :
 O(n) : For cases where n is 10^16, this brute force approach will give a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE).

 Space Complexity :
 O(1) - constant 
```

### Optimised Approach :

``` 

```

``` 
 Time complexity :
- O(log n) - since we are using divide and conquer approach so everytime we are executing recursive function for (n/2) times


 Space Complexity :
- O(log n) - (due to the depth of the recursion stack)
```
