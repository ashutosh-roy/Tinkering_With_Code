## Stack 
- It is a list in which insertions and deletions are allowed at one end of the list. This end is the top of the list.

- LIFO Principle (Last In, First Out):
Elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) from the top of the stack. The last element pushed onto the stack is the first one to be popped off.

##### Operations:
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack. Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack. Peek: Returns the top element without removing it.

##### Use Cases:
Function call stack in programming languages.
Undo mechanisms in text editors and applications.
Expression evaluation (e.g., infix to postfix conversion).
