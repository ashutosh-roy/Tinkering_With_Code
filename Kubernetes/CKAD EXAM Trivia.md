With `TECK30`, I got a discount of 30% and it costed me around 311$ (~26,810)

##### Tips and Tricks 
1. dry-run=client will help you a lot
    
2. Habits of using “kubectl explain” will save tons of minute during exam.
    
3. Relying on docs will reduce efficiency so try to be less rely on docs and more on above 2.

4. Beside that practice on “edit” “patch” “rollout” “scale” commands probably 5-6 questions would be related to them.

5. If you fail in the first attempt, remember the questions that you are failing. There's a good chance the same question may appear in your next attempt. It's what happened with me. So think why you failed, then practise more and try to give the second attempt under a week.
    
6. Practise on the CK-X simulator. Even if you are only preparing for CKAD, I will suggest you to take the CKA exam too on the sim. [https://github.com/sailor-sh/CK-X](https://github.com/sailor-sh/CK-X). It's free, runs locally, and unlike killer.sh you can retry many and many times.
