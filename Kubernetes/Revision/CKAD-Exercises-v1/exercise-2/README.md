# Exercise - 2

You sometimes need to observe a pod's logs and write those logs to a file for further analysis.

- Deploy the counter pod to the cluster using the provided YAML spec file at counter.yaml
- Retrieve all currently available application logs from the running pod and store them in the file
log_Output.txt, which has already been created

# Solution

## Step 1
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: counter
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    args: [/bin/sh, -c, 'while true; do echo $(date); sleep 1; done']

```
## Step 2
```sh
kubectl create -f .\counter.yaml
pod/counter created
```
## Step 3
```sh
kubectl logs counter
