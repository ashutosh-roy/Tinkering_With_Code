COULDN"T answer this one. I'll need to understand the meaning of all these

  clusterip      Create a ClusterIP service
  externalname   Create an ExternalName service
  loadbalancer   Create a LoadBalancer service
  nodeport       Create a NodePort service

kubectl create service nodeport messaging-service --namespace=marketing --tcp=6379:6379

Did it with some common sense but let's understand all of the above!
